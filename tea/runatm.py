# =============================================================================
# This program runs TEA over a pre-atm file that contains multiple T-P points.
# The code first retrieves the pre-atm file, and the current directory
# name given by the user. Then, it sets locations of all necessary modules
# and directories of files that will be used. It allocates an array to store
# the final abundances for each species of each T-P run. The program loops over
# all lines (T-P points) in the pre-atm file and executes the modules in the
# following order: readatm.py, makeheader.py, balance,py, iterate.py, and
# readoutput.py. Iterate.py executes lagrange.py and lambdacorr.py.
# Readoutput.py reads results from the TEA iteration loop executed in
# iterate.py. The code then opens the final atm file to write the results.
# It takes first common lines from the pre-atm file and writes the data from
# the stored pressure, temperature, and abundances array. The code has a
# condition to save or delete all intermediate files, time stamps for checking
# the speed of execution, and is verbose for debugging purposes. If these files
# are saved, the function will create a unique directory for each T-P point.
# This functionality is controlled in the TEA.cfg file. The final results with
# the input and the configuration files are saved in the results/ directory.
# The pre-atmospheric file, config file, and abundances file used for this run
# are copied to inputs/ directory.
#
# This module prints on screen the current T-P line from the pre-atm file, the
# current iteration number, and informs the user that minimization is done.
# Example:
# 5
#  100
# Maximum iteration reached, ending minimization.
#
# The program is executed with in-shell inputs:
# runatm.py <MULTITP_INPUT_FILE_PATH> <DIRECTORY_NAME>
# Example: ../TEA/tea/runatm.py ../TEA/tea/doc/examples/multiTP/atm_inputs/multiTP_Example.atm example_multiTP
